### Frontend Challenge 4: Hash-Based SPA Routing

- **Decription**  
Build a simple web app that uses the hash part of the URL for client-side routing and deploy it to Arweave.
- **Why?**  
This routing method is easy to implement and fits Arweave’s permanent storage model. AR.IO gateways can’t execute server-side code, so it's best for small apps that don’t need SEO optimization.
- **Tools**  
Arx, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, etc.
